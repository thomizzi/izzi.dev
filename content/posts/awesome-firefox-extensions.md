I thought it would be interesting to list most of the browser extensions that I use every day.

## uBlock Origin
> uBlock Origin is not an "ad blocker", it's a wide-spectrum content blocker with CPU and memory efficiency as a primary feature.

[Get uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)

## I don't care about cookies
> Get rid of cookie warnings from almost all websites!

[Get I don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/i-dont-care-about-cookies/)

## SponsorBlock
> Easily skip YouTube video sponsors. When you visit a YouTube video, the extension will check the database for reported sponsors and automatically skip known sponsors. You can also report sponsors in videos.
