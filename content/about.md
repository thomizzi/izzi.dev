# Me

## TL;DR

- I'm Thomas, Full-Stack Developer from Belgium, working in Luxembourg.
- I don't suck too much with : PHP with Laravel ❤️ / JS with VueJS & Nuxt.js.
- I'm currently working as a development manager.
- I like wasting my time on : RTS games, break/hack stuff, coding personal projects that I will never finish and losing money through bad decisions with cryptocurrencies.
